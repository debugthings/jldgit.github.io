<h2>OWASP Slides and Code</h2>
<p>First of all thanks for coming out! I enjoyed learning from all of the speakers and making a few new connections. If you'd like to know more, or you want to connect use the buttons on the right side of the page to find me on Twitter or LinkedIn. I am always happy to connect and help.</p>
<p>Please use the following links to find the slides and the demo site. All code is free to use. If you would like the raw presentation in PowerPoint format, let me know and I'll be happy to send them out.</p>

<p>Please read the instructions for building and running the site. If you have any questions, my contact information is in the slides. The best way is to try Twitter. I'm always around.
