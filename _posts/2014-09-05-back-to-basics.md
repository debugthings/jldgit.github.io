Sometimes you need to get rid of all of the shit that makes up a "good" blog platform and roll your own. I don't mean to take away merrit from these platforms, but it just wasn't what I needed.

I picked up the GitHub/Jekyll platform for blogging because it simplifies my toolset. I don't have to go in and out of different web pages, saving, posting, previewing, deleting. I just fire up Vi, Nano, notepad, or even Visual Studio and just start writing. If there is a change to a style or page in particular I can change it rather easily using Jekyll and the liquid templating framework written by shopify.

Some things that are "useful" but not needed:
##Comments
Really this feature is overrated. I like feedback as much as the next person. But a lot of times this section gets littered with advertisements and distracting asides; AKA **SPAM**.
##Link backs
Just like the comments this feature can add a lot of SPAM to a page.
##Prefab Templates
I might sound a bit pretentious at this point and it's just going to get worse. Prefab templates a great for boiler plating a website. But, being a developer I sometimes feel I'm cheating and that I can do better. Templates are a crutch that has lead me to a failed blog just about every time. Also, I can't get behind paid templates either. I think when I see a template I like that's paid it saddens me because I know I could make something that looks like that but I'm too lazy.
##Blog groups
I'm iffy on listing this because it can help group like minded blogs, but really just serves to drive traffic away from your contet.
