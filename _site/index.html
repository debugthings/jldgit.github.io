    More often than not I do postmortem debugging. That is to say, I get a dump file long after the machine has experienced an issue. But, on occasion I get pulled in to take a look at problems that need to be run through the debugger. This article will show you some commands you can use to locate and fix code using WinDbg.

    Usually when I performance test my applications I don't consider bandwidth unless I know we're doing something irrational like transferring multi gigabyte files all the time. And even then I only consider it if we're crossing a WAN or some other "slow" link between sites. But, every now and then there is a project that runs over the internet and it is very data intensive. And, a lot of that data is out of the control of the developers (images, 3rd party libraries, fonts).

    While thumbing through Twitter I ran across an article written by @grabnerandi about a company not being able to load test a change for dependency injection. I can't tell you how many times in my job that performance testing has been brushed over for speed to market.

    Every now and then a balance needs to be struck from the every day coding of an application. While personal life is usually the topic for these types of posts, today that is not the case.
