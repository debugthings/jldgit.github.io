    Back in early October my company sent me to <a href="http://http://compuwareperform.com/">Perform 2014</a>. While there, I met with some great people and found out that I&#39;m not alone. It was also very humbling. I liked that. But, with all of the meeting I found that there were a lot of people who didn&#39;t know where to turn to for help. Turns out there is a very active user community. I wanted to get involved.

    Our BI team is currently going through an uplift from Win2k3 to Win2012. It is quite a massive undertaking of course. But, beyond the amount of work that has to be done there is another dangerous killer out there.  Undocumented changes. In this article I describe the System.Security.HostProtectionException in relation to SSRS and custom code.

    More often than not I do postmortem debugging. That is to say, I get a dump file long after the machine has experienced an issue. But, on occasion I get pulled in to take a look at problems that need to be run through the debugger. This article will show you some commands you can use to locate and fix code using WinDbg.

    Usually when I performance test my applications I don't consider bandwidth unless I know we're doing something irrational like transferring multi gigabyte files all the time. And even then I only consider it if we're crossing a WAN or some other "slow" link between sites. But, every now and then there is a project that runs over the internet and it is very data intensive. And, a lot of that data is out of the control of the developers (images, 3rd party libraries, fonts).

    While thumbing through Twitter I ran across an article written by @grabnerandi about a company not being able to load test a change for dependency injection. I can't tell you how many times in my job that performance testing has been brushed over for speed to market.
