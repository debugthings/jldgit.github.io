  <p>Sometimes you need to get rid of all of the shit that makes up a &quot;good&quot; blog platform and roll your own. I don&#39;t mean to take away merrit from these platforms, but it just wasn&#39;t what I needed.</p>

<p>I picked up the GitHub/Jekyll platform for blogging because it simplifies my toolset. I don&#39;t have to go in and out of different web pages, saving, posting, previewing, deleting. I just fire up Vi, Nano, notepad, or even Visual Studio and just start writing. If there is a change to a style or page in particular I can change it rather easily using Jekyll and the liquid templating framework written by shopify.</p>

<p>Some things that are &quot;useful&quot; but not needed:</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Really this feature is overrated. I like feedback as much as the next person. But a lot of times this section gets littered with advertisements and distracting asides; AKA <strong>SPAM</strong>.</p>

<h2>Link backs</h2>

<p>Just like the comments this feature can add a lot of SPAM to a page.</p>

<h2>Prefab Templates</h2>

<p>I might sound a bit pretentious at this point and it&#39;s just going to get worse. Prefab templates a great for boiler plating a website. But, being a developer I sometimes feel I&#39;m cheating and that I can do better. Templates are a crutch that has lead me to a failed blog just about every time. Also, I can&#39;t get behind paid templates either. I think when I see a template I like that&#39;s paid it saddens me because I know I could make something that looks like that but I&#39;m too lazy.</p>

<h2>Blog groups</h2>

<p>I&#39;m iffy on listing this because it can help group like minded blogs, but really just serves to drive traffic away from your contet.</p>
