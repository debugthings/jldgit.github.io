A few weeks ago I was invited to attend [WOPR24][wopr] in San Jose, CA. After talking to the event organizer I had a big onset of impostor syndrome since I would be chatting with the likes of Facebook performance engineers and Microsoft Lab engineers. I can say that I feel pretty honored and humbled by being asked to go.

##Testing in Production
I am going to give a short 30 minute experience report on how we've had to test in production
