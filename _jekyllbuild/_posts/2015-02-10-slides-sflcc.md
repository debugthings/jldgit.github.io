Thanks everyone for coming out to my two sessions at [South Florida Code Camp][sflcc], I had a great time speaking! I met some great folks out there in the community and was excited to see how many people are active in learning and keeping their skills relevant.

You can find my slides on the [SFLCC One Drive][odrive]. These are PDF versions of the Power Point. If you would like a copy of the full Power Point, feel free to contact me and I will send a copy.
