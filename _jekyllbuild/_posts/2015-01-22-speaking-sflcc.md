I was just accepted the other day to speak at the [South Florida Code Camp][sflcc] for two topics: OWASP Top 10 Security and Load Testing with Azure. This should be a great time. I feel pretty honored to be among some great leaders in the industry.

If anyone is interested in attending it is free to everyone. It is being held at Nova South Eastern College in Davie, FL; which is just 20 minutes out from Miami on February 7th. All of the details can be found in the link at the top of the page.

I will be posting a link to the slides after my presentations on Feb. 7th unless there are issues getting on-line that night.
