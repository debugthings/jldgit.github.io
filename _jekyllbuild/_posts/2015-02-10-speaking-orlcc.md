I was just accepted the other day to speak at the [Orlando Code Camp][orlcc] for my topic on OWASP Top 10 Security. This is the third time I've delivered this presentation and I'm still excited about it. Security is not overlooked by anyone today and developers who are just getting into MVC or even seasoned professionals need to take a look at how they approach it.

The slides for this session will be the same as the ones from OWASP page. The site will be the same, save for the fact that I am going to make it more generic than before. Also, if you've seen my preso before, this one will be more interactive. I plan on explaining the top 10, but this time I want to do more demo and less lecture. Wish me luck.
