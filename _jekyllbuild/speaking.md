# Speaking
I've been motivated to give back to the community that I have learned from in the past 10 years. If you liked my sessions hit me up on Twitter and let me know. Even if you didn't like them, let me know!

If you want to contact me directly about a speaking opportunity or know of any that I should attend, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.
